I'm a Din√© environmental health scientist in training. My research investigates the distribution of metal exposures in groundwater and diet across US indigenous communities and their relationship with chronic health conditions. I use epidemiologic, biostatistical and qualitative methods to assess these relationships.

I hope to expand research capacity in indigenous health and, ultimately, inform tribal and federal regulations to <u>reduce environmental exposures in rural, historically marginalized communities.</u>

I am currently a first year Ph.D student in the [Department of Environmental Health Sciences](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/environmental-health-sciences-ehs) at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I'm a trainee with the [Columbia Northern Plains Superfund Research Program](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/columbia-superfund-research-program), a [Provost Diversity Fellow](https://provost.columbia.edu/content/provost-diversity-fellows), and a [Agents of Change Fellow](https://agentsofchangeinej.org/fellows/). I hold an M.P.H. in Environmental Health Sciences from [Columbia Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/) (2021), and a B.A. in Native American Studies and Global Health from [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu/) (2017).
